The goal of bayefdr is to provide tools for the estimation and optimisation
of Bayesian expected false discovery and expected false negative rates.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bayefdr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bayefdr")
devtools::install_github("bayefdr")
```

## Example

The basic input to this function is a vector of probabilities and a target FDR.

```{r example}
library(bayefdr)
probs <- runif(100)
efdr <- efdr_search(probs, target_efdr = 0.1)
plot(efdr)
```
